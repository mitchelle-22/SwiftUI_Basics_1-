# SwiftUI_Basics_1-


This SwiftUI Weather App project focuses on learning various SwiftUI layout structures (ZStack, VStack, HStack), the usage of @ViewBuilder, @State, @Binding, and the process of refactoring code.

**Introduction**
This weather app serves as an educational project aimed at mastering SwiftUI layout structures and property wrappers. Throughout the development process, we delve into various SwiftUI concepts, including:

ZStack: Layering views to create the weather interface.
VStack and HStack: Organizing views vertically and horizontally.
@ViewBuilder: Building complex views by combining multiple components.
@State and @Binding: Managing and updating state within the app.
Refactoring: Enhancing code readability and maintainability.
