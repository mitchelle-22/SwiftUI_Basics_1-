This SwiftUI Weather App project focuses on learning various SwiftUI layout structures (ZStack, VStack, HStack), the usage of @ViewBuilder, @State, @Binding, and the process of refactoring code.

**Introduction**
This weather app serves as an educational project aimed at mastering SwiftUI layout structures and property wrappers. Throughout the development process, we delve into various SwiftUI concepts, including:

ZStack: Layering views to create the weather interface.
VStack and HStack: Organizing views vertically and horizontally.
@ViewBuilder: Building complex views by combining multiple components.
@State and @Binding: Managing and updating state within the app.
Refactoring: Enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
Xcode 15 or 15 beta
macOS version compatible with Xcode 15

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
https://github.com/mitchelle-22/SwiftUI_Basics_1-.git
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app in the Xcode simulator or a connected iOS device.



## Features

- Weather data displayed using SwiftUI layout structures.
- Dynamic UI updates with changes in weather conditions.
- `@State` and `@Binding` usage for managing user interactions and data flow.
- Code refactoring techniques applied for improved maintainability.

## Learning Objectives
### `ZStack`, `VStack`, `HStack`
Explore the usage of these layout structures to create a visually appealing weather interface. Understand how to layer views, organize content vertically and horizontally, and compose complex UIs.

### `@ViewBuilder`
Learn to compose views and improve code readability by creating reusable components using the ***`@ViewBuilder`*** attribute.

### @State and @Binding
Master the concepts of managing and updating state within SwiftUI views using ***`@State`*** and ***`@Binding`***.

## Code Refactoring
Understand the importance of refactoring and learn techniques to refactor code for better readability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Examples
Include code snippets or screenshots showcasing the implementation of various SwiftUI concepts within the Weather App.
